   1. The information you submit

      1. When you log on to [user.newbe.pro](https://user.newbe.pro/) through a third-party site (for example, Github, Gitee), we record your corresponding email information.This is to give you a unique account so that you can use the features on the site later.

         1. The hash of the favorite address.On the one hand, this is a unique identifier that locates each link, and on the other hand, the hash value, because of its security, ensures that no one but you can get the original content of the address.
         2. The tag of the favorite address.This is information that you created manually.This part of the information is transmitted in clear text in order to be able to synchronize correctly.Therefore, we strongly recommend that you do not fill in the tags with private information that could harm your security.
