## v0.6.0

In this release, we've brought a lot of new features

### Supports the generation and sharing of AF code

You can now generate AFCode via the share button on the page.Once you've got AFCode, you can quickly import your favorites into your favorites by searching the bar.This is useful for the following scenariosÔºö

- You have a great resource to share with your friends, but copying links manually doesn't feel cool at all
- You have a wonderful URL that you can't help but share with others that you want to share with a wide range of netizens through your blog posts, but some blog sites don't support hyperlinks (such as WeChat Public Number)
- You feel like you're amazing about some of your favorite Tag tags and have to give your friends a good look, but it's a bit silly to copy each Tag manually

Therefore, solo music is not as good as public music.Come and share with the latest AFCode.

Try copying this to your search barÔºö

```bash
af://1eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnRlZGdlLm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vYWRkb25zL2RldGFpbC9hbWF6aW5nLWZhdm9yaXRlcy9ia25qZ2Jwa2Fsb2FqY3BoY2NwY25haGVnZmdsZmllaSIsInQiOiJBbWF6aW5nIEZhdm9yaXRlcyAtIE1pY3Jvc29mdCBFZGdlIEFkZG9ucyIsInRzIjpbXX0=
```

### Faster and better interaction experience

We moved the interactive dialog box for collecting and editing bookmarks to the management page.

This allows you to edit your labels faster, which is great compared to the annoying waits you've had before.

(Of course, you need to pin the management interface to the tabs for this to work.)

### Popular tags

We've added a "hot tag bar" below the search bar, where the tags you click will show up so you can find your tags more easily.
