## v0.7.0

In this release, I've brought content enhancements for cloud storage and UI improvements.

### ‚öô functionality

#### Support using GoogleDrive and OneDrive to sync your data

Now, in addition to using the Newbe API, you can sync your data across multiple devices with GoogleDrive or OneDrive.

You can enable the corresponding provider in the control panel.

Once turned on, you can sync your data with the button in the upper right corner of the Manager UI.

Whenever the sync succeeds, you can be prompted through the Manager UI.

#### Search for history auto-tips

Now, when you successfully search and click on the search results, the current search text is recorded so that you can prompt the next time you search.Enhance your accessibility to commonly used content.

#### Apply guidance enhancements

We've improved the display of the upper right button to make it easier to understand.

We are very concerned about the privacy of your data, so when the user's privacy policy changes, a prompt will pop up that you need to reconfirm.Until we have your reconfirmation, we will stop some of the relevant features that interact with the cloud to ensure that you have full access to information.

We will now collect anonymous program data with your consent to provide reference for our continuous improvement programs.

Turning this on does not collect any privacy data about you personally, so we invite you to the Control Panel to open it, and your support is a great help to the healthy development of this program.

You can operate this switch in the control panel at any time.

The extension will pop up on the first installation of the Welcome Page so that users can quickly become familiar with the extension.

### üåü UI

#### New head bar

A more comfortable-looking layout and control placement scheme.

#### Notification Center

We have included all useful notifications in the latest notification centre, so that you can learn about the status and operation of the system efficiently.

#### Control Panel UI improvements

The Control Panel UI has understood each feature with a small revision so that you can easily understand each feature.

When a feature is not enabled, helpful information about the feature is displayed so that you can understand what it does.

When you enable specific features, panels will be folded by default to reduce the use of space.Of course, you can still tap the title to expand the panel to see the details in it.

#### Enhanced improvements

We've added a presentation and tips for token expiration times to the control panel.And when the application starts, you'll be prompted if it's about to expire

### üêû bug fix

- Fixes an issue where you can't import if there is a duplicated name in the Favorites hierarchy
- Fixes an issue where the CPU is too high when editing tags
- Now, the way you first open managerUI has changed from query strings to AfEventHub.This prevents the user from accidentally popping up the edit box.
- It supports the use of Seq to output logs when development, which seems easier to troubleshoot
- Fixes an issue where program errors may occur when application insight is not enabled.
