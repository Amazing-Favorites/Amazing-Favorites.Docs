### üõ† Improvements and Fixes

- Fixes an issue where the CPU is too high when editing tags

### üåü Support using GoogleDrive and OneDrive to sync your data

Now, in addition to using the Newbe API, you can sync your data across multiple devices with GoogleDrive or OneDrive.

You can enable the corresponding provider in the control panel.

### ‚≠ê Search history autoprompt

Now, when you successfully search and click on the search results, the current search text is recorded so that you can prompt the next time you search.Enhance your accessibility to commonly used content.

### üõ† Control Panel UI improvements

The Control Panel UI has understood each feature with a small revision so that you can easily understand each feature.

When a feature is not enabled, helpful information about the feature is displayed so that you can understand what it does.

When you enable specific features, panels will be folded by default to reduce the use of space.Of course, you can still tap the title to expand the panel to see the details in it.

![better buttons](/images/20210815-001.png)

We are very concerned about the privacy of your data, so when the user's privacy policy changes, a prompt will pop up that you need to reconfirm.Until we have your reconfirmation, we will stop some of the relevant features that interact with the cloud to ensure that you have full access to information.

![Privacy Agreement changed](/images/20210815-002.png)

We will now collect anonymous program data with your consent to provide reference for our continuous improvement programs.

Turning this on does not collect any privacy data about you personally, so we invite you to the Control Panel to open it, and your support is a great help to the healthy development of this program.

You can operate this switch in the control panel at any time.

### Supports the generation and sharing of AF code

You can now generate AFCode via the share button on the page.Once you've got AFCode, you can quickly import your favorites into your favorites by searching the bar.This is useful for the following scenariosÔºö

- You have a great resource to share with your friends, but copying links manually doesn't feel cool at all
- You have a wonderful URL that you can't help but share with others that you want to share with a wide range of netizens through your blog posts, but some blog sites don't support hyperlinks (such as WeChat)
- You feel like you're amazing about some of your favorite tags and have to give your friends a good look, but it's a bit silly to copy each Tag manually

Therefore, why not share your happiness to your friends.Come and share with the latest AFCode.

Try copying this to your search barÔºö

```bash
af://1eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnRlZGdlLm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vYWRkb25zL2RldGFpbC9hbWF6aW5nLWZhdm9yaXRlcy9ia25qZ2Jwa2Fsb2FqY3BoY2NwY25haGVnZmdsZmllaSIsInQiOiJBbWF6aW5nIEZhdm9yaXRlcyAtIE1pY3Jvc29mdCBFZGdlIEFkZG9ucyIsInRzIjpbXX0=
```

### Faster and better interaction experience

We moved the interactive dialog box for collecting and editing bookmarks to the management page.

This allows you to edit your labels faster, which is great compared to the annoying waits you've had before.

(Of course, you need to pin the management page to the tabs for this to work.)

![better UX](/images/20210805-002.gif)

### Popular tags

We've added a "hot tag bar" below the search bar, where the tags you click will show up so you can find your tags more easily.
