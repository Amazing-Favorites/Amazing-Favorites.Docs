Welcome to installing and using Amazing Favorites, and let's take a short 2 minutes to see how to quickly use this extension.

## Open UI

You can right-click on the extension icon to open the management interface:

When you first open it, an editing interface will automatically pop up, which is useful in normal times because of the default behavior of clicking on the icon for automatic collection.

Now, let's close the editing interface by clicking the "Cancel" button in the lower right corner to see what the management interface looks like

## Pin Tab

The management interface load takes a few seconds each time, and you can pin the management interface to your browser.This allows you to operate as quickly as possible with each operation：

You can right-click on the tab, select pin tab and you can pin the page.

This will automatically load the interface each time you restart your browser, eliminating the time it takes to load for the first time.

## Add a favorite

By default, extensions initially import favorites into the interface within 30 seconds.

You can then add pages to your collection by clicking on the small icon of the extension.
